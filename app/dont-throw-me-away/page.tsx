              Disposable lighters are a huge source of plastic pollution. Billions
              end up in landfills every year, where they take centuries to break
              down, leaking harmful chemicals into the soil and water.
            </p>
            <p>
              The simplest way to fight this is to **stop buying disposable lighters.**

            <p>
              Refillable lighters are a fantastic alternative. While they might cost
              a little more upfront, they save you money and save the planet in
              the long run.

              <li>
                <strong>Clipper:</strong> Most Clipper lighters are easily refillable
                and their flints are replaceable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Zippo:</strong> The classic windproof lighter. It&apos;s built to
                last a lifetime with refills and wick/flint replacements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Refillable Butane Lighters:</strong> Many &quot;torch&quot; style lighters
                can be refilled using a can of butane gas, which is widely
                available.
