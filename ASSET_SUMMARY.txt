RECOMMENDATIONS - PRIORITY ORDER
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY - CONSOLIDATE BRANDING ASSETS
Items: 9 files (89 KB+ combined estimated)
- LOGOSMALL.png, NEWLOGOLONG.png, NEWLOGOLONG2.png, NEWLOGOSMALL.png, LOOOOGO.png
- 66c0f160cdd922093cbdb82c_SMILE.png, SMILE.png, LIGHTMYFIRE.png
Action: Audit brand guidelines and keep only active logo variants
Impact: Reduce public folder size, simplify branding management

MEDIUM PRIORITY - REMOVE ABANDONED ILLUSTRATIONS
Items: 12 files from /public/illustrations/
- All trophy_* variants (4 files) - replaced by newassets versions
- Community illustrations (big_group, commenting, community)
- Other unused illustrations (confused, flame_item, presentation_card, sharing, variety)
Action: Verify no references exist, remove outdated folder
Impact: Reduce public folder by ~5 MB+

LOW PRIORITY - VERIFY SVG AND SUPPORT IMAGES
Items: 5 files
- SVG files: file.svg, globe.svg, next.svg, vercel.svg, window.svg
- Images: circle-scatter-haikei.png, SEE1.png, seethrough.png, favicon.png, refilling-butane-lighter.jpg
Action: Check if used in build process, CSS, or external references
Impact: Clean up small files if confirmed unused

ASSET ORGANIZATION IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

CURRENT STRUCTURE (Issues):
- Multiple branding iterations in root
- Old illustrations mixed with abandoned assets
- Unclear asset purpose/usage from naming

RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE:
public/
├── logos/
│   ├── logo-primary.png (active)
│   └── BRANDING_ARCHIVE/ (for historical reference only)
├── illustrations/
│   ├── active/ (8 current files)
│   └── archived/ (old illustrations for reference)
├── newassets/
│   ├── trophies/ (10 trophy PNGs)
│   ├── lighters/ (lighter variants)
│   ├── processes/ (refill process diagrams)
│   └── ui/ (background layers, etc)
├── flags/ (keeps current structure - dynamic refs)
└── other/ (GIF, webclip, etc)

TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

Dynamic Asset References:
- Flags are excluded from this report as they use dynamic country code references
- Trophy system uses hardcoded image imports, all validated as used
- Sticker system directly references files in multiple services (PDF, Printful)

Build Considerations:
- LOGOLONG.png is critical: used in 3 API routes + Header
- sticker_bg_layer.png is critical: used in both client and server sticker generation
- All newassets are critical: trophy system depends on specific file names

Search Methodology:
- Searched source files: .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .css, .html
- Excluded: node_modules, .next build directory
- Pattern matched: exact filename and relative path from public/

FILES GENERATED
================================================================================

1. ASSET_USAGE_REPORT.md (detailed markdown report with categories)
2. ASSET_USAGE_DETAILED.csv (spreadsheet-ready format)
3. ASSET_SUMMARY.txt (this file)

NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review high-priority branding consolidation
2. Back up old illustrations before removal
3. Update documentation with new asset structure
4. Run this report periodically (quarterly recommended)
5. Consider implementing automated asset auditing in CI/CD
