---

## Core Voice Characteristics

### 1. **Playfully Purposeful**
We're serious about sustainability but express it with lightness and creativity. We believe change happens through joy, not guilt.

**Examples:**
- "I'm Too Young To Die" (Hero title - lighters speaking in first person)
- "Whoa there, speedy! 🏃‍♂️" (Rate limit message)
- "Welcome back, LightSaver! Your lighters missed you. 💫"

### 2. **Warmly Inclusive**
We speak as friends welcoming you into a global family. Every interaction should feel like a warm invitation, never corporate or distant.

**Examples:**
- "Be the first to add a post and start its journey."
- "Join thousands of LightSavers making a difference, one lighter at a time."
- "Ready to give a lighter a second life? 🔥"

### 3. **Poetically Practical**
We balance metaphorical beauty with clear, actionable language. Our philosophy is poetic; our instructions are crystal clear.

**Philosophical tone:**
- "Your lighter becomes a living artifact, a message in a bottle."
- "It's the silent witness to a great conversation, the spark for a new friendship."

**Practical tone:**
- "Flip it over. Do you see a small, round metal valve?"
- "Hold for 3-5 seconds. You will hear a hissing sound as it fills."

### 4. **Celebratory & Encouraging**
Every action—no matter how small—is worth celebrating. We recognize contributions with genuine enthusiasm.

**Examples:**
- "Story added! 🎉 You just made this lighter's journey a little brighter."
- "Congratulations! 🌟 You just lit the first spark in this lighter's story."
- "🏆 Trophy Unlocked: {trophy_name}! You're on fire!"

## Emoji Usage Guidelines

**Strategic, Not Excessive**
- Use emojis to add warmth and visual interest (1-2 per message max)
- Prefer them in success messages, notifications, and calls-to-action
- Avoid in error messages unless softening a difficult message
- Never use in legal/technical documentation

**Common emoji themes:**
- 🔥 💫 ✨ (achievement, magic, spark)
- 🌍 🌟 (global community)
- 🎉 🚀 (celebration, launch)
- 🏆 (achievements)

---

## Humor Style

### Light & Self-Aware
We don't take ourselves too seriously. Humor is gentle, never sarcastic or exclusionary.

**Examples:**
- "Oops! Looks like the internet hiccupped." (Error message)
- "That's part of the fun!" (About losing a lighter you saved)
- "For events or really distracted individuals" (50-sticker pack description)

### Never Mean-Spirited
Even when correcting behavior (rate limits, content flags), maintain kindness and explain the "why."

**Example:**
- "Take a 24-hour break to let others add to this lighter's story, then come back! (This helps keep our mosaic diverse and interesting for everyone.)"

## Language Specifics

### Sentence Structure
- **Short, punchy sentences** for CTAs and navigation

- Present tense: "You're on fire!" (not "You were on fire!")
- Conversational contractions: "It's" "You're" "We're"

**Avoid:**
- Corporate jargon: "utilize," "leverage," "synergy"
- Passive constructions: "is being processed"
- Overly formal: "Upon completion" → "When you're done"

### Key Terminology (Maintain Consistency)
- **LightSaver** (capital L, capital S) - never "light saver" or "lightsaver"
- **lighter** (lowercase) - the physical object
- **Lighter Babies** - when personifying lighters collectively

- **journey** - a lighter's story over time
- **PIN** (all caps) - the unique code
